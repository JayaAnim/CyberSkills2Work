Without their support, the program wouldnâ€™t be able to offer cybersecurity training and job opportunities to underrepresented and underserved populations. Thanks to our program partners, more transitioning military personnel, first responders, veterans, women, and minorities can launch or advance in cybersecurity jobs. An alliance of federal and multistate government agencies, nonprofit organizations, and American companies devotes time and resources to promote and fund CyberSkills2Work."
